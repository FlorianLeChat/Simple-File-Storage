# Simple File Storage

Here is one of my very first small project about web development. Having still limited knowledge on this subject, I simply wanted to discover the possibilities
of the most popular languages, namely : [HTML 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [CSS 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS),
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) (**client**) and [PHP 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) (**server**). This project doesn't use any
library or external help, at least for the moment.

Obviously, since I work on this project for my studies, the comments and the content is in my native language: French but the code is obviously understandable
to all people knowing how to use these languages.

It is not necessary to specify, you need a server (local or dedicated) to use this project and running **PHP 7 or higher**. The saved files are in a directory
named *"public* which **MUST** be created beforehand, otherwise no backup will be made.

Here is the current result : (it may not be up to date now).
